## 🏆 What Makes EAL Unique (The "No One Did That" List)

1. **No one combined all 3 domains** — misinformation + mental health + religion in one platform
2. **No one used MIST-20 in an Egyptian context** — we're the first to apply this psychometric in Arabic
3. **No one built an Autopilot** — our platform can demonstrate itself with one button press
4. **No one applied Negative UX scientifically** — we deliberately stress users to build cognitive resilience
5. **No one tagged every exercise with COM-B** — 42 exercises, each with documented behavioral targets
6. **No one cited every claim** — every statistic on our platform has a hover citation
7. **No one built 16 themes for psychological experiments** — each theme triggers different cognitive processing
8. **No one made it fully bilingual Arabic/English with RTL** — instant language switching, zero reload
