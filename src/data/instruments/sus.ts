 * In: Usability Evaluation in Industry, pp. 189-194.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Items use the EXACT original wording from Brooke (1996).
 * The word "system" must NOT be changed to "platform" or "app" —
 * doing so invalidates the psychometric properties (α = .91).
 * Brooke explicitly states that "system" can refer to any product
 * being evaluated — the word is intentionally generic.
 *
 * - 10 items, Likert 1-5 (Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree)
 * - Score: 0-100
 * - Benchmark: >= 68 above average, >= 80.3 = A (top 10%)
 * - Adjective ratings: Sauro & Lewis (2016)
 * - Post-only assessment

/**
 * SUS Scoring Algorithm (Brooke, 1996):
 * - Odd items (1,3,5,7,9): contribution = response - 1
 * - Even items (2,4,6,8,10): contribution = 5 - response
 * - Total = sum of contributions × 2.5 → scale to 0-100
 *
 * Benchmarks (Sauro & Lewis, 2016):
 * - >= 80.3: Grade A (excellent), top 10%
 * - >= 68: Grade B (above average)
 * - >= 51: Grade C (average)
 * - < 51: Grade F (poor)
 *
 * Adjective scale (Bangor et al., 2009):
 * - 85+: Best Imaginable
 * - 73-85: Excellent
 * - 52-73: Good / OK
 * - 38-52: Poor
