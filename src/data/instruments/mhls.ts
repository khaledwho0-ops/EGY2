 * MHLS (Mental Health Literacy Scale) Instrument
 * Framework: §3.2.2
 *
 * O'Connor, M., & Casey, L. (2015). The Mental Health Literacy Scale (MHLS):
 * A new scale-based measure of mental health literacy.
 * Psychiatry Research, 229(1-2), 511-516.
 *
 * - 35 items across 6 sections
 * - Score range: 35-165 (items 1-10 max 4, items 11-35 max 5)
 * - α = .873
 * - Pre + Post assessment
 *
 * IMPORTANT: These are REPRESENTATIVE items illustrating the structure of O'Connor &
 * Casey (2015). The exact licensed wording has NOT been reproduced here pending
 * author permission. Do not present these items as the validated instrument verbatim.
 * Section groupings follow the published factor structure.
 *
 * Response scales:
 * - Items 1-15: "Very unlikely" (1) to "Very likely" (4) or "Definitely unwilling" (1) to "Definitely willing" (5)
 * - Items 16-19: Knowledge items (varied response options)
 * - Items 20-35: "Strongly disagree" (1) to "Strongly agree" (5)
 *
 * NOTE: The MHLS requires author permission for research use.
 * This implementation includes representative items from each section
 * based on the published factor structure.

/**
 * MHLS Items
 *
 * Section 1: Recognition of disorders (items 1-8, scored 1-4)
 * Section 2: Risk factors and causes (items 9-10, scored 1-4)
 * Section 3: Social distance / willingness (items 11-12, scored 1-5)
 *   NOTE: Items 11-12 measure social-distance attitudes (willingness to live near /
 *   socialise with a person with mental illness), NOT self-treatment knowledge.
 *   The original O'Connor & Casey (2015) label for this section could not be
 *   confirmed from the published abstract; tagged 'social_distance' to match content.
 * Section 4: Social distance / willingness continued (items 13-15, scored 1-5)
 *   NOTE: Items 13-15 measure willingness to befriend, work alongside, or have a
 *   person with mental illness marry into one's family — all social-distance items.
 *   Tagged 'social_distance' to match content; original section heading unconfirmed.
 * Section 5: How to seek information (items 16-19, scored 1-5)
 * Section 6: Attitudes (items 20-35, scored 1-5; some reversed)
